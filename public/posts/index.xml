      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you the author or the narrator of your thoughts? It&amp;rsquo;s an obvious one you think as you respond to
that question in your mind. But why are you thinking about if you&amp;rsquo;re the author or narrator at all?
Without the prompting of the opening question, would that be something you would be thinking about
today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When having a conversation, how much of what you say is pre-planned and pre-written in your mind,
and how much just&amp;hellip; comes out. I&amp;rsquo;d imagine it&amp;rsquo;s quite heavily in favour of the latter, even if you
have pre-arranged ideas of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
